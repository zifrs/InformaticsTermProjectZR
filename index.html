<title> Untangling a Part of New York City’s Housing Crisis </title>
<h1> Context </h1>
<p> Raise your hand if you want to own your own home? Raise your hand if that quest is unreachable? We are in a housing crisis. The median rent in New York city is $3,600/month or 43,200/year (Once, 2025). Meanwhile, the median mortgage payment per the Motley Fool is not much better at $3,260/month, or $39,120/year (Caporal, 2025). To be rent burdened, per the census, per the census is to spend more than 30% of income on housing (US Census Bureau, 2024). For the median renter, that would be $144,000/year, and for the owner, that would be $130,400/year . Meanwhile, per the census reporter, the median household income is about $76,500/year, way less than the rental burden threshold for either rental and household burden. That means tht if you were the median New Yorker you would have to spend more than 50% of your pre-tax income on housing (Census Reporter, 2023). </p>
<h1> Motivation </h1>
<p> One of the proposed explanations of the affordability crisis in NYC might be that certain areas in the city have vacant homes that can otherwise be filled - e.g., Airbnbs or other types. My project scoped out this relationship, or lack thereof, between these vacancies and property values I seek to go back to see what trends occur over the past 14 years (2010-2023), and what correlations, if any are there between vacancy and affordability.</p>
