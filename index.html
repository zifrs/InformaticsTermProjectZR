<h1> Untangling a Part of New York City’s Housing Crisis </h1>
<h2> Context </h2>
<p class= "indent"> Raise your hand if you want to own your own home? Raise your hand if that quest is unreachable? We are in a housing crisis. The median rent in New York city is $3,600/month or 43,200/year (Once, 2025). Meanwhile, the median mortgage payment per the Motley Fool is not much better at $3,260/month, or $39,120/year (Caporal, 2025). To be rent burdened, per the census, per the census is to spend more than 30% of income on housing (US Census Bureau, 2024). For the median renter, that would be $144,000/year, and for the owner, that would be $130,400/year . Meanwhile, per the census reporter, the median household income is about $76,500/year, way less than the rental burden threshold for either rental and household burden. That means tht if you were the median New Yorker you would have to spend more than 50% of your pre-tax income on housing (Census Reporter, 2023).
</p>
<h2> Motivation </h2>
<p class="indent"> One of the proposed explanations of the affordability crisis in NYC might be that certain areas in the city have vacant homes that can otherwise be filled - e.g., Airbnbs or other types. My project scoped out this relationship, or lack thereof, between these vacancies and property values I seek to go back to see what trends occur over the past 14 years (2010-2023), and what correlations, if any are there between vacancy and affordability.
</p>
<h2> Methodology </h2>
  <p class="indent">  The aim of this final project is to use Python, show the correlation (or lack thereof) between property values and vacancy in New York City, between 2010 and 2023.
</p>
 <p class="indent"> 
   To do so, first, census data was acquired using the API, where from the American Community Survey (ACS), I got five-year counts from 2010 to 2023 ACSs for census tracts, as those were the only years available and that it would give enough of a timeline - 14 years to show significance (or lack thereof). In the tables of B25002 (Occupancy Status) - with the counts for, Total Housing Units, Occupied Housing Units, and Vacant Housing Units were found. For B25003, Tenure was found with the counts for “Total Occupied Units,” “Owner Occupied Units,” and “Rental Occupied Units.” Finally, for B25064 (Median Gross Rent), and B25077 (Median Home Value), were acquired. 
   </p>
  <p class="indent"> 
    Next, to avoid further errors, the plus signs for values in B25064, and B25077 were stripped, and any non-numeric values in those became numeric. 
   </p>
  <p class="indent"> 
    However, the 2010s data and 2020s data had different census tracts. Thus, I split the 2010s data, and the 2020s data into two datasets, and since the majority of my data was in 2010 tracts, I used 2010 tracts as reference. 
   </p>
  <p class="indent"> 
    To convert the 2020 tracts to 2010 tracts, I used the IPUMS 2020 to 2010 crosswalk data, while keeping the 2010 tracts. For the 2020 data, IPUMS algorithms would convert the census metrics back into 2010 data. While not reliable, it would get the job done and preserve most of the data. 
   </p>
  <p class="indent"> 
    Subsequently, “Vacancy Rate” was calculated by dividing the variables “Vacant Housing Units” by Total Housing Units, while owner and renter proportion was found by dividing “Owner_Occupied_Units”/”Total Housing Units”, and owner proportion was fund by doing similar but instead of using owner units, it used “Renter_Occupied_Units.”
   </p>
  <p class="indent"> 
    To prevent merging errors, the merged data, now all in 2010s tract, was standardized, and the 2010 tracts, which came from the NYC Department of City Planning, were merged into the dataset. Coordinate reference systems were checked and verified to be state plane. 
   </p>

   </p>  
   <p class="indent"> 
     First, the amount of housing units/ Census Tract was measured, which was measured using ACS “Total_Housing_Units”. NA values were clipped, and a timestamped map was made to show visual shifts in the timeframe. Note that the scale was transformed from a normal scale to a logarithmic scale (of base 2) to better show diversity in housing units per tract. (Figure 1). 
   </p>
   <p class="indent"> 
     Next, the changes in housing units between 2010 and 2023, both in raw values and in percentages, are calculated, NA values were removed, and a static flow map was made to show shifts. Like the timestamped map, a log base-2 scale was used to make a more visually appealing map (Figures 2 and 3).

    Subsequently, the number of units in 2010 and 2023, the raw number change in number of units, and the percent change calculated for the city overall (all available tracts). <br>
Below are the results: <br>
Total Units 2010: 2,884,276 <br>
Total Units 2023: 3,083,075 <br>
Change in New York city's housing stock (2010–2023): 198,799 <br>
Percent Change in New York city's housing stock (2010–2023): 6.89% <br>
  </p>
  A time-stamped vacancy rate/ Census Tract is then presented on Folium using a similar methodology to that of the “Total_Housing Units” paragraph above but with the “Vacancy Rate” column instead (Figure 4).
    <p class="indent">
      Similarly, the change in percentage (first derivative of vacancy rate) between 2010 and 2023, and the rate of change for the change in percentage of vacancy rate (second derivative of vacancy rate) between 2010 and 2023 are graphed using the similar methodology relative to the changes in housing units (Figures 5-6).

  <p> NYC's total vacancy rate changed from 8.94% in 2010 to 9.67% in 2023, a 0.73 percentage-point increase (8.14% relative change), which shows an insignificant change in vacancy.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      Next, the missing units were calculated. Missing units are units that are not occupied at the current vacancy rate (which is 8-9 for the city overall), which would have been occupied had the vacancy rate hit a target rate. In this case, it is the normal 5% rate. These are the units that developers take offline for a while, or Airbnb left fallow. 
  </p>
    <p class="indent">
      The missing units/ Census Tract timestamped were mapped in a similar manner to both vacancy %/ Census Tract and housing units/ Census Tract, showing shifts in missing units between 2010 and 2023 (Figure 7).
  </p>
    <p class="indent">
      Similarly, the change in missing units between 2010 and 2023, and the rate of change for the missing units between 2010 and 2023 are graphed using the similar methodology relative to the changes in housing units and vacancies, except that for certain % change if the value is 0/0,  the value is not present, as it is literally indeterminate (Figures 8-9).

     The missing units stats are calculated for the city overall. Below are the results for missing units for the city overall <br>
Missing Units 2010: 143,437  <br>
Missing Units 2023: 165,171  <br>
Total Gain 2010-2023: 21,734  <br>
Percent Change 2010-2023: 15.15%  <br>
  </p> 
   <p class="indent">
     Given the 2010 vacancy rate of 8.94% and the 2023 vacancy rate of 9.67%. Compared with the growth of housing (6.89%), and vacancy growth (8.14% relative change between 8.94 and 9.67%), a 15.15% change is much, much faster. Moreover, the value of growth seems to be the roughly the sum between the growth of housing in % and the relative change in vacancy % (15.03% vs 15.15%).
  </p>
     <p class="indent">
       Last but not least comes weighted property values which were calculated by  first finding/ Census Tract the number of units owned or rented/ Census Tract, which were in “Owner_Occupied_Units” and “Renter_Occupied_Units. For owned units this value is then multiplied by median property value and called “owned_value”. Then for rented units this value is multiplied by median rent and 360 to mimic each rent payment as a monthly payment  30 year mortgage (which is 360 months), being called “rental_unit_value”. Then the weighted property value is calculated as Owner_Proportion by “owned_value,” and rental_proportion by rental_unit_value.
  </p>
     <p class="indent">
       The Weighted Property Value/ Census Tract timestamps were mapped in a similar manner to both Missing Units/ Census Tract vacancy% %/ Census Tract and housing units/ Census Tract, showing shifts in property values units between 2010 and 2023 (Figure 10).
  </p>
     <p class="indent">
       Similarly, the change in Weighted Property Value/Unit/ Census Tract between 2010 and 2023, and the rate of change for the Weighted Property Value/ Census Tract between 2010 and 2023 are graphed using the similar methodology relative to the changes in housing units, vacancies, and missing units.

       The weighted property value stats are calculated for the city overall. Below are the results for missing units for the city overall <br>
NYC Median Property Value 2010: $450950.78 <br>
NYC Median Property Value 2023: $763,066.57 <br>
Median Property Value Gain between 2010-2023 $312,115.78 <br>
Percent Change 2010-2023 69.12% <br>
  </p>
  <p class="indent">
    For the city, the median property value growth of 69.12% outdoes every other metric, and it is not even close. Relative to the 15.15% percent change in missing units, 6.89% growth in housing, and 8.14% relative change in vacancy, the sheer percentage is outside of this world.

  </p>
  <p class="indent">
    Finally, to calculate the correlation between the percentage change  in missing units between 2010 and 2023 (independent variable), and the percentage change in property between 2010 and 2023/ Census Tract (Figures 9,12), a scatterplot was established, with a normalization using the ln (x) or natural log of (x) to straighten out the chart. The chart is below (Figure 13). As you can see, there is no correlation, with the pearson coefficient of 0.017 showing as such. Therefore, there is no logarithmic correlation between the change in vacant homes that are fillable and the change in home prices.
  </p>
   In other words, at least in NYC, filling in the vacant units we already have would do little to influence housing prices. 
    <p class="indent">
      However, there might be relationships worth exploring in the future, as a lack of vacancy in certain neighborhoods may indicate rising property values/gentrification. While Airbnbs or developers putting units online might not cause the crisis, low vacancy might.
